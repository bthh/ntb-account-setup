# Review Mode Section Switching Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: In review mode, switching between sections within the same entity (e.g., John Smith Owner Details → John Smith Firm Details) would update the title but not the actual displayed fields.

**Root Cause**: The `renderReviewMode()` function was showing ALL data fields from the current entity regardless of which section was active, rather than filtering to show only the fields relevant to the current section.

## Technical Fix

### Before
```typescript
// Showed ALL fields regardless of section
const filteredData = Object.entries(currentFormData).filter(([key]) => key !== 'fundingInstances');
```

### After
```typescript
// Filter data to only show fields relevant to the current section
const sectionFields = requiredFields[section] || [];
const filteredData = Object.entries(currentFormData).filter(([key]) => {
  // Always exclude fundingInstances (handled separately)
  if (key === 'fundingInstances') return false;
  
  // If we have section-specific required fields, only show those
  if (sectionFields.length > 0) {
    return sectionFields.includes(key);
  }
  
  // Otherwise show all fields (fallback)
  return true;
});
```

## How It Works

### Section-Specific Field Filtering
The fix uses the existing `requiredFields` mapping to determine which fields belong to each section:

**Owner Details** shows only:
- `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth`, `ssn`, `phoneHome`, `email`, `homeAddress`, `citizenship`
- `employmentStatus`, `annualIncome`, `netWorth`, `fundsSource`

**Firm Details** shows only:
- `totalNetWorth`, `liquidNetWorth`, `averageAnnualIncome`, `incomeSource`
- `investmentExperience`, `stocksExperience`, `bondsExperience`, `optionsExperience`
- `liquidityNeeds`, `emergencyFund`, `scenario1`

**Account Setup** shows only:
- `accountType`, `investmentObjective`, `riskTolerance`

**Funding** has special handling to show funding instances grid

## User Experience Improvement

### Before Fix
- ❌ Title updated but content stayed the same
- ❌ All fields visible in every section
- ❌ Confusing and misleading UX

### After Fix  
- ✅ Both title AND content update correctly
- ✅ Only relevant fields shown per section
- ✅ Clear, section-specific review experience
- ✅ Proper navigation between sections within same entity

## Testing Scenarios Now Working

1. **John Smith**: Owner Details → Firm Details → Account Setup
2. **Mary Smith**: Owner Details → Firm Details  
3. **Joint Account**: Account Setup → Funding → Firm Details
4. **Cross-entity**: John Smith Owner Details → Joint Account Funding

All section switches now properly filter and display the correct fields for each section.

## Technical Benefits

- **Reuses existing field mapping**: Leverages `requiredFields` structure
- **Maintains data integrity**: Each section shows only its relevant data
- **Fallback handling**: Shows all fields if section mapping is missing
- **Special case support**: Funding section still gets custom rendering
- **Performance**: Reduces DOM elements by filtering unnecessary fields
