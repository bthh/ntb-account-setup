# V1 Field Replication Summary

## ✅ Complete Field Structure Matching Achieved

I've successfully replicated the actual fields for each page from the V1 UI screens, restructuring the V2 forms to exactly match V1's organization and content.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Owner Details Form (Now Complete ✅)
**V1 Structure**: 
- Account Owner Details (basic personal info)
- Address Information  
- Identification
- **Employment Information** ⬅️ (was missing in V2)
- Trusted Contact Information

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ Added **Employment Information** section with:
  - Employment Status
  - Annual Income Range  
  - Net Worth Range
  - Source of Funds
  - Disclosure Questions (financial services affiliation, professional advisor)
- ✅ All fields now match V1 exactly

### 2. Firm Details Form (Completely Rebuilt ✅)
**V1 Structure**: Financial Suitability Assessment
- Net Worth Assessment
- Investment Experience  
- Liquidity Needs
- Market Conditions Comfort Level

**Before**: Simple employment/income fields (moved to Owner Details)

**After**: Comprehensive financial suitability assessment with:

#### Net Worth Assessment
- Total Net Worth
- Liquid Net Worth
- Average Annual Income (Last 3 Years)
- Primary Source of Income

#### Investment Experience
- Overall Investment Experience
- Stocks Experience
- Bonds Experience
- Options/Derivatives Experience

#### Liquidity Needs
- Portfolio access needs within 2 years
- Emergency fund status
- Primary liquidity purpose

#### Market Conditions Comfort Level
- Risk tolerance scenario: "If your investment portfolio declined by 10% in one month"
- 4 response options from conservative to aggressive

### 3. Required Fields Updated
**Owner Details**: Extended to include employment fields
```typescript
'owner-details': [
  'firstName', 'lastName', 'dateOfBirth', 'ssn', 
  'phoneHome', 'email', 'homeAddress', 'citizenship',
  'employmentStatus', 'annualIncome', 'netWorth', 'fundsSource'  // Added
]
```

**Firm Details**: Completely new field set
```typescript
'firm-details': [
  'totalNetWorth', 'liquidNetWorth', 'averageAnnualIncome', 'incomeSource',
  'investmentExperience', 'stocksExperience', 'bondsExperience', 'optionsExperience',
  'liquidityNeeds', 'emergencyFund', 'scenario1'
]
```

### 4. Review Mode Field Mappings
Added proper display names for all new fields:
- `totalNetWorth` → "Total Net Worth"
- `averageAnnualIncome` → "Average Annual Income (Last 3 Years)"
- `investmentExperience` → "Overall Investment Experience"
- `scenario1` → "Market Decline Response (10% Drop)"
- And many more...

## Technical Implementation

### Form Organization
- **Owner Details**: Personal information + employment/financial basics
- **Firm Details**: Investment suitability assessment + risk profiling
- **Account Setup**: Account type and investment preferences
- **Funding**: Funding sources and instances

### Data Validation
- Updated completion status logic to handle new field structure
- Proper required field validation for both sections
- Form state management maintains context separation

### User Experience
- Radio buttons for risk scenario questions
- Comprehensive dropdown options matching V1 exactly
- Professional financial assessment flow
- Clean card-based organization

## V1 Compliance Status

| Section | V1 Compliance | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Owner Details** | ✅ 100% | All V1 fields present, correct organization |
| **Firm Details** | ✅ 100% | Complete financial suitability assessment |
| **Account Setup** | ✅ 100% | Already matched V1 |
| **Funding** | ✅ 100% | Already matched V1 with working instances |

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/AccountForm.tsx` - Complete form restructuring
- `/src/types.ts` - Updated field requirements
- Build tested and compiles successfully

## Result
V2 now **exactly replicates** the V1 UI field structure while maintaining:
- React + PrimeReact modern implementation
- Working funding form functionality
- Proper review mode with flattened text display
- Context-aware form data management
- Professional styling and responsive design

The forms now provide the same comprehensive financial profiling and suitability assessment as V1, with improved UX through modern React components.
