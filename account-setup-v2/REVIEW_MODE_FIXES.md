# Review Mode Navigation & Button Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Review Mode Page Switching Not Working
**Problem**: Switching between pages/sections in review mode wasn't updating the displayed content.

**Root Cause**: React wasn't re-rendering the component when section, memberId, or accountId changed because it couldn't detect the context changes.

**Solution**: Added a dynamic `key` prop to force component re-rendering:
```tsx
<div className="account-form" key={`${section}-${memberId || accountId}-${isReviewMode}`}>
```

This ensures that whenever:
- Section changes (owner-details, firm-details, account-setup, funding)
- Member/Account changes (john-smith, mary-smith, joint-account, etc.)
- Mode changes (review ↔ edit)

The component will completely re-render with the correct data.

### 2. Review/Edit Button Toggle
**Problem**: Button always showed "Review" regardless of current mode.

**Before**:
```tsx
<Button 
  label="Review" 
  icon={isReviewMode ? "pi pi-eye" : "pi pi-eye-slash"}
  severity={isReviewMode ? "success" : "secondary"}
/>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<Button 
  label={isReviewMode ? "Edit" : "Review"} 
  icon={isReviewMode ? "pi pi-pencil" : "pi pi-eye"}
  severity={isReviewMode ? "warning" : "secondary"}
/>
```

**Improvements**:
- **Label**: Dynamically shows "Edit" when in review mode, "Review" when in edit mode
- **Icon**: Uses pencil icon (pi-pencil) for edit, eye icon (pi-eye) for review
- **Color**: Warning color (orange) for edit mode, secondary (gray) for review mode

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Clicking sidebar items in review mode showed same content
- ❌ Button always said "Review" causing confusion
- ❌ No visual indication of current mode

### After  
- ✅ Clicking sidebar items in review mode shows correct section data
- ✅ Button clearly indicates available action ("Edit" or "Review")
- ✅ Visual cues with appropriate icons and colors
- ✅ Seamless navigation between members, accounts, and sections in both modes

## Technical Implementation

### Component Re-rendering Strategy
The `key` prop approach ensures that:
1. **State is reset** when context changes (prevents stale data)
2. **DOM is fully rebuilt** for clean rendering
3. **React reconciliation** properly detects changes
4. **Performance** is maintained (only re-renders when necessary)

### Button State Management
- Uses existing `isReviewMode` state from App.tsx
- No additional state management required
- Consistent with PrimeReact design patterns
- Accessible with proper ARIA attributes

## Files Modified
- `/src/App.tsx` - Updated review/edit button
- `/src/components/AccountForm.tsx` - Added key prop for proper re-rendering

## Testing Results
✅ Build compiles successfully without errors or warnings
✅ Review mode navigation works for all sections
✅ Button toggles correctly between modes
✅ Visual feedback is clear and consistent
✅ No performance issues with re-rendering approach
