# Funding Form Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The user reported: "after the funding instance i created was saved nothing was saved in the main grid on that page"

## Root Cause
The funding forms were not using React controlled components properly:
1. Form inputs were not connected to state (`fundingFormData`)
2. The `collectFormData` function was trying to call an undefined `getFieldValue` function
3. Form data was not being properly collected and saved to the main grid

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Controlled Components
- Updated all funding form inputs to use `value` and `onChange` props
- Connected inputs to `fundingFormData` state via `handleFundingFormChange`
- Examples:
  ```tsx
  // Before (uncontrolled)
  <InputText id="acatName" className="w-full" placeholder="Transfer name" />
  
  // After (controlled)
  <InputText 
    id="acatName" 
    value={fundingFormData.acatName || ''}
    onChange={(e) => handleFundingFormChange('acatName', e.target.value)}
    className="w-full" 
    placeholder="Transfer name"
  />
  ```

### 2. Fixed Data Collection Logic
- Replaced undefined `getFieldValue` calls with direct `fundingFormData` property access
- Added proper field name mapping for each funding type
- Added validation to ensure all required fields are filled before saving

### 3. Improved Form State Management
- Forms now properly clear data after successful save
- Added better error handling for incomplete forms
- Calendar fields properly handle Date objects

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/AccountForm.tsx` - Main funding form implementation

## Funding Types Supported
1. **ACAT Transfers** - Account transfers with firm and transfer type
2. **ACH Transfers** - Bank transfers with frequency options
3. **Initial ACH** - One-time initial transfers with date
4. **Systematic Withdrawals** - Recurring withdrawals with frequency
5. **Systematic Contributions** - Recurring contributions with bank info

## Testing Results
✅ Build compiles successfully without TypeScript errors
✅ All funding forms now use controlled components
✅ Data collection properly maps form fields to instance data
✅ Form state clears after successful save
✅ Instances appear in unified grid with Type, Name, Amount, Frequency columns

## User Experience Improvements
- Real-time form validation
- Clear error messages for missing required fields
- Success notifications when instances are saved
- Form automatically clears and closes after save
- All instances display in a single unified grid as requested
