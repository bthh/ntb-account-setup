# Trust Review Screen Test Results

## ✅ **Trust Review Screen Fix - COMPLETE**

### **Issue Resolution**

**Problem**: The review screen for trust fields was not working properly.

**Root Cause**: The trust-account sample data in App.tsx was missing the actual trust-specific field values, so the review mode had no data to display.

**Solution Implemented**:

#### 1. **Added Complete Trust Sample Data**
Updated the trust-account object in App.tsx with comprehensive trust information:

```typescript
'trust-account': {
  // Basic account setup
  accountType: 'trust',
  investmentObjective: 'growth', 
  riskTolerance: 'aggressive',
  
  // Trust-specific information
  trustName: 'Smith Family Revocable Living Trust',
  trustType: 'revocable-living',
  trustEffectiveDate: new Date('2020-01-15'),
  trustEin: '12-3456789',
  trustState: 'CA',
  trustPurpose: 'To manage and distribute family assets for the benefit of current and future generations of the Smith family, providing financial security and wealth preservation.',
  trusteeName: 'John A. Smith',
  trusteePhone: '(555) 123-4567',
  trusteeAddress: '123 Main Street, Anytown, CA 12345',
  hasSuccessorTrustee: true,
  
  // Funding instances (empty for now)
  fundingInstances: { /* ... */ }
}
```

#### 2. **Verified Review Mode Logic**
The review mode implementation in AccountForm.tsx was already correct:

```typescript
// Special handling for account-setup section to include trust fields if it's a trust account
if (section === 'account-setup') {
  const basicFields = ['accountType', 'investmentObjective', 'riskTolerance', 'timeHorizon'];
  const isTrustAccount = accountId === 'trust-account';
  
  // Trust-specific fields for review mode
  const trustFields = isTrustAccount ? [
    'trustName', 'trustType', 'trustEffectiveDate', 'trustEin', 'trustState', 'trustPurpose',
    'trusteeName', 'trusteePhone', 'trusteeAddress', 'hasSuccessorTrustee'
  ] : [];
  
  sectionFields = [...basicFields, ...trustFields];
}
```

### **Expected Review Mode Display**

When navigating to Family Trust Account > Account Setup > Review Mode, users will now see:

**Basic Account Information:**
- Account Type: Trust
- Investment Objective: Growth  
- Risk Tolerance: Aggressive

**Trust Information:**
- Trust Name: Smith Family Revocable Living Trust

- Trust Effective Date: 1/15/2020
